## Description
C-rypt is a software written entirely in C. It enables encryption and decryption of text from an image ([Steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography)), which can be easily shared via messaging apps like WhatsApp or Telegram. The software features a straightforward and intuitive GUI interface.

### Why
C-rypt serves as a personal project aimed at honing my skills in C programming. As I am currently learning the language, C-rypt provides a practical avenue to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, particularly in cryptography and graphical user interface development.
